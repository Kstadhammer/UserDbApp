# Helpers

Helpers are like your toolbox of common utilities - think of them as the Swiss Army knife of your application. They contain reusable methods that you'll need throughout your app.

## Real-World Examples:

### ValidationHelper

Helpers are utility classes that provide common functionality used across the application. They typically contain static methods that perform specific tasks.

Common examples in a User Database app:
- `ValidationHelper`: Email, password, and input validation
- `HashingHelper`: Password hashing and verification
- `DateTimeHelper`: Date formatting and manipulation
- `StringHelper`: String manipulation and formatting
- `FileHelper`: File operations and management

Best practices:
- Keep helpers stateless
- Make methods static
- Focus on single responsibility
- Avoid business logic in helpers
